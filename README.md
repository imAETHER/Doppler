The Doppler effect is a real-life sound phenomena that shows up as a **frequency** change when either you the listener or the source of the audio is moving, its better explained here: [Doppler Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect).

<hr>

This is a small mod that adds just that, with built-in compatibility for Simple Voice Chat and Plasmo Voice.

### Demonstration (Plasmo Voice)

### Config
Default effect "scale" is at 40%, noticeable but not too exaggerated, though I havent tested all means of movement next to audio sources, so you're free to change it in ModMenu's settings screen for the mod or in the config file located at `<minecraft>/config/doppler.cfg`, value is a decimal with ranges from 0-1 _(default: 0.4)_.

### Why?

I kept seeing Instagram reels that have "doppler effect" caption with a clip of something in Minecraft just decreasing in volume, which is NOT the effect in question!! So I made this mod, so you can hear what it really sounds like, who will use it? idk, but its fun 😸
